* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    >Jon Stein on [Betterment's Mission: Help People Live Better][9]
    >
    >>"I started Betterment when it occurred to me that the concepts I’d learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes I was making in managing my own investments.
    While economics is good at explaining the world at a macro level, it fails to explain human behavior. At a micro level, economics assumes that humans are rational, and they’re far from rational. Especially when it comes to their money; people heavily discount the future, they withdraw when markets crash, and it’s because our emotions drive our decisions."

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    >Jon Stein on [how banks fail consumers savings][10]:
    >
    >>"Somewhere in between their bank and their investment manager, Americans lose out on the most important element of finance: **Saving their cash.**
    >>
    >>Make no mistake; your savings is what matters. It’s what matters when paying down debt. It’s what matters for starting a business. It’s what matters for securing a healthy retirement.
    >>
    >>And yet, banks typically don’t help you become a better saver; they encourage holding cash at the ready for spending and sell you loans when you don’t have enough. Meanwhile, most investment managers pay little attention to your saving; they focus on larger deposits, like retirement money withheld from a paycheck. Between working with a bank and an investment manager, we, as a nation, fail to save enough for the things we need.
    >>
    >>## The everyday American deserves a cash advisor."
