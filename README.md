    >>"I started Betterment when it occurred to me that the concepts I’d learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes I was making in managing my own investments.
    While economics is good at explaining the world at a macro level, it fails to explain human behavior. At a micro level, economics assumes that humans are rational, and they’re far from rational. Especially when it comes to their money; people heavily discount the future, they withdraw when markets crash, and it’s because our emotions drive our decisions."
